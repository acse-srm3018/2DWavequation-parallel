# 2D Wave equation - Parallel programming using MPI
* 2D Wave Equation Solver with MPI
## Overview
This code solves using Finite difference method [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference]. The code is parallelized using MPI and domain decomposition techniques. It was mostly written with MPI and C++.

## Basic Information

This project aims to solve 2-D wave equation using finite difference.

## Speedup
The time it takes for the code, as measured using the dug HPC system, to execute (Different Number of grid points) relative to the number of processors used can be seen in the figure below. Note that the computational speedup from 2 to 4 processors is 1.9 and from 4 to 8 the speedup is 1.4 which is close Amdahlâ€™s Law.

## Requirements
1. only non-standard library required is `mpi.h`. 
2. Building program using `mpic++ coursework_parallel.cpp -o coursework_parallel`
3. run `mpiexec -n 4 coursework_parallel`
4. run in the following command in hpc `rjs mpi_Raha.job`
5. the output piped to a file (.out) and plotted using the
   postprocessing python code(which can be found as postprocess.ipynb
